# weeb-shit

A simple python script that accepts [HorribleSubs](https://horriblesubs.info) links and scrapes through it to make every episode of an anime into a magnet link.

Made for [Deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/) and it's AutoAdd plugin. Simply add the links to the list.json file and it should work fine.

## TODO

* Argument parsing as any changes now require manual editing
* Grouping of episodes per series on folder
* Auto check up on new episodes

### Goal
* Make necessary changes to have the script running as a service
